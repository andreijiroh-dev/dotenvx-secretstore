# Changelog

## Unreleased

TBD

## `v0.1.0` - Initial release

Initial release of the CLI with `@dotenvx/dotenvx` at `v1.6.2` at time of
release, although development used `v1.5.0` at first.

Nothing too serious other than hooking things up a bit.

### Added

* Initial `dotenvx` CLI support through the `dotenv-tools dotenvx` command.
    * We have some issues while trying to use `commands/dotenvx.js` directly via `dotenvx`. A workaround will be implemented soon.
* Add `init|setup` command, alongside some [template files used in init process](./template/)
